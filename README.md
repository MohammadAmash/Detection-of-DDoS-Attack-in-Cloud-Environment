# Detection-of-DDoS-Attack-in-Cloud-Environment

Overview:

This project presents the HKRE (Hybridized KNN and Random Forest with Ensemble Learning) model, DDoS attacks pose significant threats to cloud service availability, causing severe disruptions and financial losses. Traditional detection methods often struggle with balancing speed and accuracy, leading to delays in identifying and mitigating attacks.

Key Features:

1. Ensemble Learning:
   Integrates K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and AdaBoost algorithms to enhance detection accuracy and speed.
2. Hybridized Model (HKRE):
   Combines the strengths of KNN and Random Forest through ensemble learning, achieving an accuracy of 95% with a detection time of 12 milliseconds.
3. Scalability:
   The model is optimized for cloud platforms, ensuring efficient resource management and real-time detection capabilities.
4. Comprehensive Detection:
   The model is trained on diverse datasets, including CICDDoS2019, to detect various DDoS attack types like UDP flood, TCP SYN flood, and ICMP flood.

   
Impact: 

The proposed solution significantly improves the efficiency of DDoS detection in cloud environments, minimizing downtime and ensuring robust protection against evolving cyber threats.
