# Detection-of-DDoS-Attack-in-Cloud-Environment

Overview:

This project presents the HKRE (Hybridized KNN and Random Forest with Ensemble Learning) model, an innovative solution for detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in cloud environments. By combining the strengths of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest algorithms through ensemble learning techniques, HKRE offers enhanced accuracy and speed, ensuring minimal disruption to service availability.

Features:

1. Hybrid Model: Combines KNN and Random Forest with ensemble learning to improve DDoS detection accuracy.
2. High Efficiency: Achieves high detection accuracy with fast execution times.
3. Scalability: Seamlessly integrates with cloud monitoring services for efficient resource management and scalability.
4. Adaptability: Fine-tuned model parameters allow for dynamic adaptation to changing network conditions.
